//the calcCircleArea function uses pi in its calculation - we have not defined pi in the shapesApp.js module - why does the above code still work? Closure! Inside the circleUtils file - which again, is a module - the calcCircleArea function accesses pi. Since this is a function accessing an external functionâ€™s variables - we have closure! The value of pi is kept from within the calcCircleArea function.

//from within the shapesApp module (as it is written above), can you access title? Nope, because we did not export it from the circleUtils module.
